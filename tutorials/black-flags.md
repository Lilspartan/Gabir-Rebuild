## What is a Black Flag?
In auto racing, the Black Flag means the racing driver has a penalty for a rules infraction. This infraction can be a one time event or an accumulation of multiple, smaller events.

## How do I know I’ve been given a Black Flag?
In iRacing a Black Flag icon will be shown by default towards the top left hand corner of your display. The Crew chief audio (aka Carl) will also tell you “They’re showing us the Black Flag”. (You can move the flag in your layout using `ALT + K` and dragging it into a more prominent position.)

## What must I do if I am shown the Black Flag?
If you are shown the Black Flag you will have to serve a Penalty depending on the severity of the incident. The info box towards the top of your display will have details on the penalty, read the instructions.

It might be a drive-through penalty (drive through the pits, observing the pit speed limit under Green Flag conditions (not under a Yellow Caution Flag)), or a stop-and-go or timed stop (drive into pits, stop in your pit spot and stay there until the penalty time is served). The penalty must be served within the next 3 laps or you will be disqualified from the race by the iRacing system.

## Why have I been given a Black Flag?
There are numerous ways to get a Black Flag. The most common ways are:

- Speeding in the pit lane
- Entering a closed pit (sometimes unavoidable due to damage in oval racing, a penalty will be assessed if you must pit for repairs under a closed up)
- Unsafe pit exit (moving onto the race track before passing the blue cone/crossing the solid pit exit line)
- Accumulation of ‘incident points’ from offs, loss of control (spins) or contact (with walls or other cars). In most races the penalty point is 17 incidents but the threshold can vary
- Not giving back the time within a certain time (15 seconds) when a Slowdown penalty is issued after cutting the course

## What happens if I don’t serve my Black Flag?
If you don’t serve your Black Flag penalty within the 3 laps you will be Disqualified and removed from the race.
