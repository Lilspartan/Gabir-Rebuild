## What should I do if I am shown the Blue Flag?
**ROAD Single Class:** If in doubt stay on your normal racing line and let the faster car choose how and where to make the pass. If you feel more comfortable you can consider yielding the line to the faster driver by making a slower, much later entry to a corner or by pulling off line on a straight and briefly lifting off the throttle to facilitate the pass. Use your Relative F3 to be aware if there is more than one car making a pass.

**ROAD Multi-class:** If in doubt stay on your normal line and let the faster car (especially if a faster class) choose how and where to make the pass. If you feel more comfortable you can consider yielding the line to the faster driver by making a slower, much later entry to a corner or by pulling off line on a straight and briefly lifting off the throttle to facilitate the pass. Use your Relative F3 to be aware if there is more than one car making a pass.

**OVAL** If in doubt stay on your normal line and let the faster car (especially if a faster class) choose how and where to make the pass. If you feel more comfortable you can consider yielding the line to the faster driver by making a slower, much later entry to a corner or by pulling off line on a straight and briefly lifting off the throttle to facilitate the pass. Use your Relative F3 to be aware if there is more than one car making a pass.

## What should I expect if I don’t yield to a lapping car?
**ROAD Single Class:** Expect the passing driver to use light flashes (if available) to ‘insist’ on you facilitating the pass. After several flashes (usually about a lap or so depending on the speed difference) expect a forceful pass attempt.

**ROAD Multi-class:** Same as above but if the car is a faster class expect the flashes immediately as a warning and the forced pass to come much sooner.

**OVAL** Expect the passing driver to tailgate. Within a lap or so expect to be lightly bumped to encourage you to move off line. If you still do not or cannot yield expect a more forceful bump. If a third bump is required expect it to be the last bump before the one against the wall.
